Tooling for my local dev env on OSX
===================================

Contains a docker-compose file to start some services on a docker host.

I use these to develop against since they are way easier to manage compared to local installs of the packages.

Usage
-----

```bash
docker-compose up -d

open http://hostlist.vcap.me/
```
